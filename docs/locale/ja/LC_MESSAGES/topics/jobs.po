#: ../../topics/jobs.rst:23
msgid ""
"To enable persistence support you just need to define a *job directory* "
"through the ``JOBDIR`` setting. This directory will be for storing all "
"required data to keep the state of a single job (ie. a spider run).  It's"
" important to note that this directory must not be shared by different "
"spiders, or even different jobs/runs of the same spider, as it's meant to"
" be used for storing the state of a *single* job."

msgstr ""

#: ../../topics/jobs.rst:45
msgid ""
"Sometimes you'll want to keep some persistent spider state between "
"pause/resume batches. You can use the ``spider.state`` attribute for "
"that, which should be a dict. There's a built-in extension that takes "
"care of serializing, storing and loading that attribute from the job "
"directory, when the spider starts and stops."

"Cookies may expire. So, if you don't resume your spider quickly the "
"requests scheduled may no longer work. This won't be an issue if you "

msgid "Request serialization"
msgstr ""

#: ../../topics/jobs.rst:74
msgid ""
"Requests must be serializable by the ``pickle`` module, in order for "
"persistence to work, so you should make sure that your requests are "
"serializable."

"The most common issue here is to use ``lambda`` functions on request "
