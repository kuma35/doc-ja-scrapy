"Although Python makes sending e-mails relatively easy via the `smtplib`_ "
"library, Scrapy provides its own facility for sending e-mails which is "
"very easy to use and it's implemented using `Twisted non-blocking IO`_, "
"to avoid interfering with the non-blocking IO of the crawler. It also "
"provides a simple API for sending attachments and it's very easy to "
"configure, with a few :ref:`settings <topics-email-settings>`."
